            Panhala fort (also known as Panhalgad (In Marathi), Pahalla and Panalla (literally "the home of serpents")),
            is located in Panhala, 20 kilometres northwest of Kolhapur in Maharashtra, India. It is strategically located looking over
            a pass in the Sahyadri mountain range which was a major trade route from Bijapur in the interior of Maharashtra
            to the coastal areas.[1] Due to its strategic location, it was the centre of several skirmishes in the Deccan involving,
            the Marathas, the Mughals and the British East India Company, the most notable being the Battle of Pavan Khind.
            Here, the queen regent of Kolhapur State, Tarabai, spent her formative years. Several parts of the fort and the structures
            within are still intact

        <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
            Panhala fort was built between 1178 and 1209 CE, one of 15 forts (others including Bavda, Bhudargad, Satara, and Vishalgad)
built by the Shilahara ruler Bhoja II. It is said that aphorism Kahaan Raja Bhoj, kahan Gangu Teli is associated with this fort.
A copper plate found in Satara shows that Raja Bhoja held court at Panhala from 1191–1192 CE. About 1209–10, Bhoja Raja was
defeated by Singhana (1209–1247), the most powerful of the Devgiri Yadavas, and the fort subsequently passed into the hands
of the Yadavas. Apparently it was not well looked after and it passed through several local chiefs.
In 1376 inscriptions record the settlement of Nabhapur to the south-east of the fort.
