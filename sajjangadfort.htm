            History of fort</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
            The fort was built by Bahamani rulers in between (1347-1527). Later (1527-1586) it came in possession of the Adilshahi dynasty.This fort was captured by Shivaji on 2 April 1663 from Adilshah. Previously known as Parali, it was renamed to Sajjangad. Fateullahakhan's army encircled the fort on 21 April 1700 and finally captured it on 6 June 1700. After it became the part of Mughal empire, it was renamed as "Navrastara".This fort was again won by Marathas. It remained in Maratha hands until the demise of the Maratha empire by the British in 1818.
