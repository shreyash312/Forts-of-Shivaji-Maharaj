            Torna Fort is also known as Prachandgad. The Marathi word prachand means ‘huge’ in English. The name Prachandgad itself
suggests the spread of the fort. This huge fort is perched in the
great Sahyadri Ranges in the district of Pune in Maharashtra state of India and boasts to be the
tallest in the district with an altitude of 1405 meters from the sea level.
Historical Significance:
Every fort in Maharashtra has its own historical significance. So does Torna. This is the first fort
captured by Chhatrapati Shivaji in his fifty year legendary career. He captured Torna in
1646 at the age of 16 and thereby declared his revolt against the tyrannical Mughal Empire.
Torna thus becomes the nucleus of the Maratha empire.

            History of fort</h1>
        <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
            It is said that the fort was constructed in the thirteenth century by the Shaivas i.e. the followers
            of Lord Shiva. Near the entrance of the fort you can see the temple of Tornaji Devi also known
            as Menghai Devi. The fort has been named Trona after Tornaji Devi. It is also said that the fort
            was named so owing to the large number of toran trees present on the fort.
            In 1643 when Shivaji captured the fort, he renamed Prachandgad as Torna. He also built several
            towers and monuments on the fort in order to strengthen the defense of the fort and to
            enhance the beauty and the grandeur of the place.
            In the 1700s after Sambhajiraje’s (Shivaji’s son) assassination, the Mughals got hold of the fort
            once again. After this victory Aurangzeb, the then Mughal Emperor, renamed the fort as,br> Futulgaib.
             The source of this word could not be traced; but its meaning is Divine Victory. The
            name denotes the difficulties Mughals had to face while trampling down the solid defense of
            the Marathas. The fort was restored to the Marathas under one of the clauses in the second
            treaty of Purandar.
            As a Tourist Spot:
            Torna makes one of the most popular historical monuments in the district. Especially during the
            rainy season, the site attracts oodles of tourists. Moreover, lovers of adventure look at Torna
            as a paragon for trekking. The fort is undoubtedly difficult to climb up and thus stands as a
            challenge for the trekkers. Over the last decade the Government of Maharashtra has been
            trying to develop the site as a tourist spot and also to preserve the significance of the fort as a
            historical monument.

        <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
           
            1) Bini Darwaaza:
            The spectacular aerial view of the surrounding region is the main attraction of the Bini Darwaaja. If you are coming from
            the village Velhe which lies at the foothills of the fort Bini Darwaaza is the main entrance for you.
            2) Kothi Darwaaza:
            The road from the Bini Darwaaza takes you to the Kothi Darwaaza. From here you can go to the stone carved steps that
            lead to the Tornaji Temple. You see beautiful idols of goddess Somjai and goddess Tornaji in this temple.
            3) Hanuman Batsion:
            To the eastern part of the Kothi Darwaaza stands a sturdy bastion called Hanuman bastion. The idol of Lord Hanuman here
            will catch your attention.
                4) Bhel Bastion: Zunjar Machi
            Slightly ahead of the Hauman Bastion you reach the Bhel Bastion. The famous Zunzar Machi lies in the eastern part of the Bhel
            Bastion. This machi had remained inaccessible till a few years ago when a short rock-climbing session was successful.
            Later an sturdy iron ladder has been put on the wall of the fort making the access to the Zunjar Machi easier.
            5) Budhla Machi:
            Yet another attraction on the Torna fort is the Budhla Machi. “Budhla” is a Marathi equivalent for English ‘vessel’.
            If observed minutely, the structure of this Machi looks exactly like a vessel kept upside down. From here you have
            a route heading towards the Sanjeevani Machi on the Rajgad. The route to Sanjeevani Machi springs through the Alu Darwaaza.
