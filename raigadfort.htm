            History of fort</h1>
        <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
            It was here that Shivaji built his capital city in the 14th century. Shivaji was coronated here by Brahmin priests
            of Benaras who poured water of the holy Ganges in the Gangasagar tank at the fort. Besides, the tank now stands at the
            crumbling ruins of the 40-feet-high towers, which display Mughal architecture. Barring these towers, Raigad, named after
            the Rairi hill, was constructed and fortified by Shivaji and his engineers, notably Abaji Sondev, the then governor of Kalyan.
            Shivaji had wrested the strategic hill from Chandrarao More in 1656 AD. His father, Shahaji had selected the site as the capital
            of the growing Maratha Empire. For six years up to his death, Raigad remained the capital of the Marathas with its broad gates
            and magnificent monuments. There was only one pathway leading to the top, and prizes were offered to those who scaled the fort through unconventional methods.
            Today, except for Shivaji's Samadhi, his coronation site and a Shiva temple, most of the monuments inside the fort,
            including the Queens' palace, are in ruins. The statue of the founder of the Maratha Empire stands without any roof or
            shelter not far away from the spot where Shivaji was coronated with pomp. Though parts of Raigad are in ruins, yet they
            inspire an aura of grandeur.
