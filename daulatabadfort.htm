            Located 15 km away from the main city of Aurangabad, Daulatabad Fort is an ancient fortification that rises formidably from the midst of verdant greenery. Often hailed as one of the 'seven wonders of Maharashtra', this architectural marvel is believed to have been built in the 12th century. Also known as Devgiri fort, perhaps the most enchanting qualities is its location, from the zenith of which you can capture a mesmerising view of the entire city. You need to hike some 750 odd steps up to the top, but the view down below is a wonderful thing to behold.

            One of the most inspiring aspects of the Daulatabad Fort is its design which makes it one of the most powerful fortresses of the medieval period. It is built on a 200 metres high conical hill, which provides this grand fortress with a strategic position, architectural beauty and protection from the enemies. Another unique aspect of the mighty Devgiri Fort is its engineering genius, which not only provided an impregnable defence against enemy forces but also managed irreplaceable resources of water quite well. The contrast of the ancient edifice against the lush green fields of Aurangabad paints a wonderful picture that takes you back through the pages of the days bygone.

            History of fort</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
            The town of Daulatabad was once known as 'Devgiri' meaning the 'the hill of gods'. The entire township was developed by the King of Yadava dynasty, Raja Bhillamraj Yadav in 1187. The fort is considered among the best-preserved forts in the country which has survived several years without any alteration. The prosperous kingdom of Yadava dynasty was taken over by the Tughlaq dynasty of Delhi under the leadership of Mohammad Bin Tughlaq who captured the town of Devgiri along with the two forts.

At the beginning of 1327, when the city of Devgiri was taken over by the Tughlaq dynasty, the name of the place was forcefully changed from Devgiri to Daulatabad. In 1328, Daulatabad was completely taken over by the Sultanate of Delhi and was established as a capital of Tughlaq dynasty for the coming two years. The huge population was moved to Daulatabad in order to set up the rule of Tughlaq dynasty in the city. The city was abandoned by the Delhi rulers due to the lack of water supply in the area. Within the span of two years, the capital of the Tughlaq dynasty was soon shifted back to Delhi leaving Daulatabad in an abandoned state.

            June to September
But be careful of slippery roads in and around the fort if you travel to Daulatabad during the monsoon season. But if you are lover of the rain and do not mind getting wet then this is the perfect time to visit the town.
