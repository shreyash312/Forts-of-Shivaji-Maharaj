            History of fort</h1>
        <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
            A large castle placed in the Satara district of Maharashtra, the Pratapgad Fort is a very important site as the legendary
            Battle of Pratapgad was fought here. Now a popular vacationer destination, the Pratapgad Fort is placed 22 km from Mahabaleshwar
            at 1,080 meters above sea level. Built at such a location, the fort oversees the roads connecting the villages of Par and Kinesvar.
            
            As per the historians, the Maratha king Shivaji Maharaj had commissioned Moropant Trimbak Pingle,
            his then prime minister, to commence the building of this fort for the purpose of defending Nira and
            the Koyna rivers’ banks, and also to guard the Par pass. Finally the construction of the fortress was finished in 1656.
            Also, the Battle of Pratapgad was fought between Shivaji and Afzal Khan on November 10, 1659 below the unbridled area
            of this fort. This was certainly the first most important test of the fledgling kingdom's defence force,
            and it laid the foundation brick for the rise of the Maratha Empire.
            
            Pratapgad Fort is divided into 2 parts namely the lower fort and upper fort. The upper fort was constructed
            upon the crest of a hill and is approximately 180 m long on each of its sides having numerous permanent edifices.
            There is a shrine of Lord Mahadev, positioned towards the northwest portion of the fort, bordered by cliffs
            of height above 250 m. On the other hand, the lower fort is sited at the southeast end of the fort, being defended
            by tall towers and strongholds which are 10-12 metre high.
