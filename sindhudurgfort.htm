            Sindhudurg is a fortress which occupies an islet in the Arabian Sea, just off the coast of Maharashtra
            in western India. The fortress lies on the shore of Malvan town of Sindhudurg District in the Konkan region of Maharashtra,
            south of Mumbai.
            
            Sindhudurg (Sindhu = sea, Durg = fort) was built by the great Maratha warrior leader Shivaji in 1664.
            Shivaji selected the strategic rocky island location, 'Kurte' for the fort himself, to counter foreign forces,
            and to keep the nearby Siddis of Murud-Janjira in check.
            
            Over 4000 mounds of iron were used in the casting and foundation stones were firmly laid down in lead. The
            construction was started on 25 November 1664. Built over a period of three years, the sea fort is spread over 48 acres
            (190,000 m2) with a two-mile (3 km) long rampart, and walls that are 30 feet (9.1 m) high and 12 feet (3.7 m) thick.
            The massive walls were designed to serve as a deterrent to approaching enemies and to the waves and tides of the Arabian Sea.
            The main entrance is concealed in such a way that no one can pinpoint it from outside.

        <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
            After selecting the island for building a fort, the auspicious day for building the foundation was chosen as 25th November 1664.
             There is a sacred rock near Malvan called “Moryacha Dhonda”, which represents has carvings of Lord Ganesh, the Sun and the Moon
             and Shiv Linga. This sacred rock was worshipped before starting construction of Sindhudurg fort. There are detailed letters which
              describe many aspects about the vision of building forts of Shivaji Maharaj and the details associated with it. One such letter 
              details out the resources required for Sindhudurg. There were about 500 masons, 200 blacksmiths, 100 Portuguese and 3000 workers
              who worked for 3 years continuous to complete the fort. The characteristic of Sindhudurg is that the foundation stones are laid down
              in slots and molten lead was poured to fix them strongly. The lime stone was ordered from central part of the Deccan plateau.
             Shivaji Maharaj had written specific details on resource management in his letters, and was personally present on 29thMarch 1667
             when the fort was completed.
            After the death of Rajaram Maharaj in 1700, Tarabai ruled the Maratha Empire from Satara. As per the treaty of Warna between Shahu
            and Tarabai, Malvan came under her control. By that time piracy had increased near Malvan coast. Major Gordon and Captain Watson 
            captured the fort on 28 January 1765 and renamed it as Fort Augustus. In an Anglo-Maratha truce the fort was returned to Marathas
             on 2nd January 1766. In 1792 the British again regained the fort by helping Karveerkars against Desai of Nipani.
