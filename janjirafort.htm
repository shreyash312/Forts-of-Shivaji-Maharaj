            Murud-Janjira Fort is situated on an oval-shaped rock off the Arabian Sea coast near the port city of Murud, 165 km (103 mi) south of Mumbai.
            Janjira is considered one of the strongest marine forts in India. The fort is approached by sailboats from Rajapuri jetty.
            The main gate of the fort faces Rajapuri on the shore and can be seen only when one is about 40 feet (12 m) away from it. It has a small postern 
            gate towards the open sea for escape.
            Entry Gate into Murud Janjira Fort. Accessible by ferry.
            The fort has 26 rounded bastions, still intact. There are many cannons of native and European make rusting on the bastions.
            Now in ruins, the fort in its heyday was a full-fledged living fort with all the necessary facilities, e.g., palaces, quarters for officers,
            mosque, two small 60-foot-deep (18 m) natural fresh water lakes, etc.[8] On the outer wall flanking the main gate,
             there is a sculpture depicting a tiger-like beast clasping elephants in its claws.
            The palace of the Nawabs of Janjira at Murud is still in good shape.
            A special attraction of this fort are 3 gigantic cannons named Kalalbangdi, Chavri and Landa Kasam. These cannons were said to be
             feared for their 
            shooting range. Another gate to the west is sea-facing, called 'Darya Darwaza'.
            There is also another fortress, named Ghosalgad, which is located on top of the hill around 32 km (20 mi) east of Murud-Janjira, that was 
            used as outpost for the rulers of Janjira.

            History of fort</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
            The history of Murud Janjira fort goes way back to the 15th century when some local fishermen of Rajapuri built a small wooden fort called Medhekot on a massive rock out in the sea to save themselves and their families from the attack of pirates. However, the Nizam Shahi Sultan of Ahmednagar wanted it to make one of his strongholds, firstly because of the vast area and secondly because of its strategic positions.

            As per the Sultan's wish, a general called Piram Khan captured the fort and Malik Ambar - the Abyssinian regent of Siddi origin and administrative spokesman of him ordered the construction of a solid rock fortress in place of the wooden garrison. After massive scale renovations to create an impregnable structure by Piram Khan's successor Burhan Khan, the fort was named Jazeere Mahroob Jazeera. Today's name Janjira is a broken down derivation of this Arabic word Jazeera which means island - it is a reference to its offshore location. Murud is a Konkani word, probably referring to the Shahi of Ahmednagar.
            
            The Murud-Janjira fort stands an unconquered one as over the years the Maratha, the Portuguese and even the mighty British tried and failed to breach the walls of this sea fort. The Siddi overlords became so powerful here that they withstood every attack and defied the sovereign itself to establish a Sultanate of Janjira.

        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
           
            Maharashtra is known for its heat in summers; and since there is the part of sea-crossing, visiting in monsoon is not really profitable because, in case of a storm or heavy rain, the boat service is stalled for obvious safety reasons. It is better to visit the fort during the more pleasant months, from October to March.
