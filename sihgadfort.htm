            Sinhagad is a hill fortress located at around 35 km southwest of the city of Pune, India. Some of the information available
            at this fort suggests that the fort could have been built 2000 years ago. The caves and the carvings in the Kaundinyeshwar 
            temple stand as proofs for the same.

            Previously known as Kondhana, the fort had been the site of many battles, most notably the Battle of Sinhagad in 1670.
            Perched on an isolated cliff of the Bhuleswar range in the Sahyadri Mountains, the fort is situated on a hill about 760 
            metres above ground and 1,312 metres above mean sea level.

            History of fort</h1>
        <pre style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">
            The Sinhgad Fort was initially known as "Kondhana" after the sage Kaundinya. It was renamed as Sinhgad fort by Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as a tribute to the
             valour of Maratha commander, Tanhaji Malusare, who lost his life in the battle with Mughals.
              The Kaundinyeshwar temple coupled with the caves and carvings indicates that the fort had probably been built around
               two thousand years ago. It was seized by Muhammad bin Tughlaq from the Koli king Nag Naik in 1328 AD.
               Shahaji Bhosale, as the commander of Ibrahim Adil Shah II, was entrusted with the control of the Pune region. His son Shivaji, refused to accept the Adilshahi 
               and initiated the task of setting up Swarajya. Shivaji gained control of Kondana in 1647 by convincing Siddi Amber, the Adilshahi
                Sardar who controlled the fort, that he, the son of Shahaji Bhosale, could manage the fort's defenses optimally. Bapuji Mudgal Deshpande
                 played a key role in this activity. Adil Shah jailed Siddi Amber for this treasonous act and schemed to get it back. He imprisoned Shahaji 
                 Bhosale for a concocted crime and informed Shivaji. In 1649, Adil Shah traded the fort for Shahaji's release. Shivaji recaptured it in 1656 
                 again with the help of Bapuji Mudgal Deshpande who convinced the Fort commander by giving land in the newly created Khed Shivapur village and 
                 peacefully gained control of the fort.
